For those of you who have always had difficulty organizing your content with CSS, this tool is for you!

The not-so-new `flexbox` layout [supported](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox) by all modern browsers is quite the step up from the old days of tables or `float` + `margin`. Although it is powerful and _flexible_, it has a bit of a learning curve.

This tool gives you the ability to visually create a flexbox layout and learn some of the common rules relating to `flexbox`.

There are a few built-in example layouts to use, or you can start from scratch.

You can configure the **container** and **item** properties separately and learn what each property is for by focusing on it.

When your layout is finished, you can copy the generated source code to your own project code and fine tune as you like.
